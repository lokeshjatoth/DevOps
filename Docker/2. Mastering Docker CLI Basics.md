Key Docker CLI Concepts
- Container Lifecycle Commands: docker run creates and starts new containers, docker start/stop/restart control existing containers, docker rm removes containers

- Image Management Commands: docker pull downloads images, docker images lists local images, docker rmi removes images, docker tag creates new tags

- Information and Inspection: docker ps lists containers, docker logs shows output, docker inspect provides detailed information, docker exec runs commands inside containers



Container Execution Modes
- Interactive Mode (-it): Connects your terminal to the container's terminal for debugging and exploration

- Detached Mode (-d): Container runs in the background, ideal for services like web servers

- Port Mapping (-p): Maps container ports to host ports using format host_port:container_port



Docker CLI Best Practices
- Always use specific image tags instead of latest in production

- Clean up regularly with docker system prune to save disk space

- Use meaningful container names with --name flag for easier management

- Check container logs when troubleshooting with docker logs container_name

- Use docker exec instead of SSH to access running containers

- Understand the difference between docker run (create + start) and docker start (start existing)

1. Run a container named `cli-demo` using the busybox image in interactive mode and open a shell.
```
docker run -it --name cli-demo busybox /bin/sh
```

2. Exit the shell to stop the container.
```
exit
```


3. List all containers (including stopped ones).
```
docker ps -a
```

4. Restart the `cli-demo` container.
```
docker restart cli-demo
```

5. Check logs from the `cli-demo` container.
```
docker logs cli-demo
```

6. Execute the `ls` command inside the running `cli-demo` container.
```
docker exec cli-demo ls
```

7. Stop the running `cli-demo` container.
```
docker stop cli-demo
```


8. Pull the `alpine` image from Docker Hub.
```
docker pull alpine
```


9. List all Docker images on your system. Remember we only pulled alpine image and busybox was auto pulled by docker run command.
```
docker images
```
